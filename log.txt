The IsWindowVisible function also counts windows on the taskbar, as visible. 
The EnumWindows function takes a function as an argument. This function is also known as callback function because it's being passed in as an argument. 
The window handle (win_handle, in my case) is supposed to be a special identifier/reference used by the operating system to keep track of the window. These handles is said to be represented usually by an integer by the OS. 

The EnumWindows function, in this case, contains two arguments. One is the callback function and the second is supposed to be the list argument required by the callback function since my callback takes two arguments.
EnumWindows iterates through each window on the computer and will pass the handle of the window to the callback function when it encounters a window. Because callback appends the title to a list, it will append it to the window_titles list provided by the EnumWindows function. 

The OpenCV's imshow() function takes two parameters (first being the title, second being the screenshot itself as a NumPy array) and displays the screenshot 
waitKey() waits for a key to be pressed, will still close the window without the destroyAllWindows() function
destroyAllWindows() function is used still, just in the case that a OpenCV window remains open after being closed. It also closes ALL OpenCV windows.

Plan: use template images, seek for the patch/area where it lies in screenshot, ask for position of where the match is found, save the positions by assigning them to variables that will be the cards/buttons, assign positions after template images are matched  

if scales arenâ€™t the same, scale the template image  

After getting the positions of everything, I can check each position for a specific string that contains the name of a unit I passed in for the user input 

Receive coordinates for skill buttons, save them (by assigning them to a class or by unit 1, 2, 3), can have user input who is in those unit slots. For swap scenarios, can make more unit slots to hold those units, look for mystic code position and its skills. For NP gauge check, find the position coordinates of the gauge for all three units and just have user tell us which unit's gauge to check for.
